# Next Place

Finding a home that's close to all your points of interest is difficult. Whether you want to be close to work, family, friends, or a community; there is not a great way to find real estate listings within a certain distance between locations. We're hoping to provide a seamless way for people to provide a set of locations and display listing that fit their unique needs.

## Getting Started (as a user)

As this project is still a proof of concept and relies on free to use technology, users will either need to limit their usage of the site or provide their own API credentials for downstream providers.

1. On the home page select the settings icon on the top right
2. Enter in your API key for each provider listed and click save. Links are provided for onboarding.
3. Enter in an address and distance of time around a point of interest
4. Click search
5. Review the area associated with your address
6. New development is in progress to continue building out updating of the initial address, adding additional addresses, and retrieving real estate listings.

## Getting Started (as a contributor)

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create _.env.local_ at the root directory
4. Add your own API keys if you'd like to inject them automatically
5. Run `npm run dev`
